Next, save your changes. 

Then you can either use RStudio or GitHub Desktop to commit and push your changes, your choice! It will depend on what you have installed and set up.

# Committing and Pushing Changes 

## GitHub

If you are using GitHub to commit and push your changes, then you should have it downloaded on your computer.

1. Open GitHub Desktop
1. Click the "Current Repository" in the upper lefthand corner
1. Click the "practice" repository
1. If you saved your changes in RStudio, you should see that there is an orange box with a dot inside. If you hover over this, it should say "modified"
1. Below this, there is a text box. This is where you will type a commit message. Remember, committing just means you are saving this to your local operating system. The message should be short but descriptive. One tip is to keep your message in present tense. An easy way to think about it is imagine you start each commit with, "This commit..." then your message. 
   - Example: Updates the participant list with my name. 
   - Example: Adds 'Michelle Slawinski' to list.
1. Press commit!
1. Now, you have saved your commit locally, but we want to push this to the remote repository on GitHub where the author can accept your changes. Press "Push."
1. Then complete a pull request in GitHub
1. Wallah!

## RStudio
If you are using RStudio to commit and push your changes, then you should have already connected GitHub and RStudio. If you did, you will see the git symbol up in the menu bar. 

1. Click the git symbol and press "commit"
1. Stage (i.e., select) the files that you want to save. 
1. Write a commit message in the description box. Like with GitHub desktop, you will want to use present tense. See above.
1. Press commit!
1. Click "Push" 
1. Then complete a pull request in GitHub
1. Wallah!
